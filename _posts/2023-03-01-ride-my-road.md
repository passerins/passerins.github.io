Winner of the August 2019 FAST Ride graphic design poster contest.

I created the winning poster design for the August 2019 FAST Ride event by using Adobe Creative Suite to develop a visually compelling poster layout that aligned with the client's brief. The brief required a design that incorporated the event's date and location, raffle prize, sponsors, and branding, while also capturing the energy of the event. 

I utilized Photoshop to create striking visuals with bold typography and colors that helped to capture the attention of potential attendees. By carefully balancing text and images, using appropriate color schemes, and ensuring a consistent design throughout, I created a poster design that effectively communicated the event's message.
