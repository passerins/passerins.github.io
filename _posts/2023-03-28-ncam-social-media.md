During my time as a Senior Social Media Coordinator at Liaison, I developed and executed social media marketing strategies for Ncam Technologies. Using my experience in social media management, I crafted engaging and informative posts for the brand's social media platforms, which helped to increase engagement, expand the brand's reach, and potentially helped them acquire new customers. 

Additionally, I created monthly social media reports that analyzed key metrics, including impressions, engagement, and follower growth, and provided insights and recommendations for future campaigns. By continually refining and optimizing Ncam's social media presence, I contributed to the brand's overall marketing strategy and helped to establish the company as a thought leader in the industry.
