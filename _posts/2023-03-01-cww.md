During my time as the Social Media Strategist for Counting Women's Work, an international research project dedicated to measuring the gendered economy, I developed and carried out a comprehensive social media strategy focused on promoting the project's research findings and raising awareness about the importance of measuring unpaid care work. 

This strategy included crafting compelling social posts, developing paid media campaigns, and analyzing social metrics to optimize future outreach efforts.
