During my time as a Senior Social Media Coordinator at Liaison, I wrote case studies detailing the success of their social media and SEO efforts for a variety of clients. These case studies included the strategies, tactics, and metrics that Liaison used to achieve success on behalf of their clients. 

While working on the social media and SEO teams, I helped gather data and insights, and collaborated with the teams to ensure that the case studies were well-written and effectively communicated the marketing strategies. These case studies served as powerful marketing tools, demonstrating their expertise in social media and SEO and their ability to deliver tangible results for their clients.
