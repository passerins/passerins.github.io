During my time as a Senior Social Media Coordinator at Liaison, I was responsible for writing, monitoring, and promoting social posts for Reed's Crossing, a new home community in Hillsboro, Oregon. The social posts were designed to engage and inform prospective homebuyers and local realtors about the community and Oregon as a whole. 

I utilized the brand’s social media platforms to showcase upcoming new home plans and gorgeous Oregon scenery, promote events and new amenities, and interact with resident’s posts. I also generated monthly social reports to track reach, engagement, and ROI. These reports helped to inform our ongoing strategy, enabling us to continually refine and improve our approach.
