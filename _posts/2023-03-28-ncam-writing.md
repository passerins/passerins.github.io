During my time as a Senior Social Media Coordinator at Liaison, I wrote several blogs for Ncam Technologies, showcasing their real-time camera tracking technology and its use in various film and TV projects. Many of the blogs were in a listicle style, which effectively highlighted a range of projects and provided insights into their techâ€™s capabilities. 

Using a conversational tone and incorporating relevant images and videos, I wrote engaging and informative blogs that appealed to industry professionals and casual readers alike. By demonstrating Ncam's expertise and the versatility of their technology through these blogs, I contributed to the brand's thought leadership in the industry and potentially attracted new customers.
