'Fish Finatic' is a magazine sample I created for a client interested in creating a publication about exotic fish. Using Adobe Creative Suite, I designed the magazine layout based on the client's brief, which included incorporating stunning visuals and interesting page grids to showcase rare and unusual fish species. 

I utilized InDesign to create the overall layout and Photoshop to edit and enhance the images. By carefully balancing text and images and using consistent formatting throughout, I created a magazine sample that effectively showcased the beauty and diversity of exotic fish while exceeding the client's vision for the publication.
