During my time as the Social Media Strategist for Southern Oregon University's Communication program, I executed a comprehensive social media strategy focused on content creation, community engagement, and data analysis. This included researching our target audience, collaborating with program faculty to create a content calendar, conducting online and in-person interviews, writing in-depth blog posts, and monitoring social media analytics to track success and identify areas for improvement.
