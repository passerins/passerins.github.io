For this project, I remade the movie trailer for Spike Lee's 'She's Gotta Have It' to give it a feminist perspective. Using Adobe Premiere Pro, I collected and curated all media, including video footage and sound effects, to create a cohesive and intriguing movie trailer. 

I incorporated my knowledge of film theory to convey appropriate emotions to the audience, such as empowerment and self-determination. By selecting scenes that highlighted the film's feminist themes, creating a balanced pacing, and using appropriate transitions and effects, I successfully reimagined the film to appeal to a more feminist audience.
