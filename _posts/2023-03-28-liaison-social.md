During my time as a Senior Social Media Coordinator at Liaison, I was responsible for creating social posts that highlighted Liaison's clientsâ€™ press releases and projects. These posts were designed to promote the client's achievements, showcase their capabilities, and increase brand awareness. I collaborated with our internal team to ensure that the posts were well-written and engaging, and utilized a variety of social media platforms to reach a broad audience.
